Here's a glimpse of several projects that I authored in my free time along with the technologies leveraged.

### Favorites Gallery App
This web app uses carousels (yes, lazy loading!), a navbar, and a router in order to display galleries of some of my favorite things. It was a product of my goal to improve my frontend abilities. Check out the app [here](https://favorites-gallery.herokuapp.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/Favorites-Gallery-App)!<br/>

```
ReactJS, React Router, React Bootstrap, React Slick, Heroku
```

### Instagram Unfollow Bot
This web app fulfills a need that I saw in the social media community arising from the lack of a secure way to check who has unfollowed oneself on Instagram. Check out the app [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/Instagram-Unfollow-Bot).<br/>

```
Python, Selenium, ChromeDriver
```
