Welcome!

🔱 I'm a UC San Diego alumni with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (class of 2021, minor in Music).

Highlights of my experience include software engineering, research, humanitarian-focused projects, and IEEE workshops—all of which helped strengthen my interpersonal and technical skills.

💻 Most recently, I enjoyed working on advancing education at MasterClass as a Software Engineer. I spent 2 years there, having converted from intern to full-time.

My past occupations have a theme of working interpersonally: engineer, code instructor, teacher, cashier. Overall, I believe in working together and improving the lives of others through technology.
