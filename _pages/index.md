Welcome!

üíª I'm James, a full-stack software engineer with over 3 years of web development experience, currently working at [Amazon One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com/) on the member-facing experience.

üî± I'm a UC San Diego alumni with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (class of 2021) and a minor in Music. Highlights of my college experience include software engineering, research, humanitarian-focused projects, and IEEE workshops‚Äîall of which helped strengthen my interpersonal and technical skills.

Before my current role, I contributed my software engineering expertise to drive the growth of [WebSpot's](https://onwebspot.com/) innovative platform, actively shaping our product during its emergence from stealth mode and refining my full-stack development skills. Prior, I worked on advancing education and scaling the commerce platform at [MasterClass](https://www.masterclass.com/) as a Software Engineer, where I spent 2 years. I transitioned from an intern on the enterprise pod to a full-time role on the commerce pod.

My past occupations have a theme of working interpersonally: engineer, code instructor, teacher, cashier. Overall, I believe in working collaboratively to improve the lives of others using technology.
