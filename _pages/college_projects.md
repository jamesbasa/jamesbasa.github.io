At UC San Diego, I was fortunate enough to architect and collaborate on meaningful projects.

### EMSTrack
Through the GlobalTies nonprofit program, I co-developed the mobile and web components of the ambulance dispatching app **EMSTrack** for [Cruz Roja Tijuana](https://globalties.ucsd.edu/what/projects/cruz-roja-tijuana.html). This platform allowed Cruz Roja Tijuana to overcome their  limitations stemming from radio communication to dispatch EMS.

As Team Lead, I organized weekly meetings and oversaw collaboration between our development, UI prototype, and business subteams. Our work was especially significant in the springtime since COVID-19 became widespread, as revealed in this [Fox article](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/border-report/uc-san-diego-professors-students-create-app-to-improve-tijuanas-ambulance-service/) and [Voice of San Diego article](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/border-report-tech-is-making-better-use-of-tijuanas-ambulances/). Check out the code [here](https://github.com/EMSTrack/CleanApp).

```
Java, REST APIs, Android development, Django models, XML
```

### TryClubs
For our CSE 110 Software Engineering project, my group architected **TryClubs**, an Android app that allows students to discover and advertise student organizations, as there was no platform that focused on this for UC San Diego. Students can discover orgs through tags then "favorite" them, while org leaders can advertise their events for students to view.

We leveraged Agile development over the course of a quarter. Watch our amazing video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ixENeMHvc&feature=youtu.be) or check out the code [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/TryClubs).

```
Java, Agile framework, Android development, XML
```

### Data Science Report
I authored a **data science report** in the form of a Jupyter Notebook for my final project in COGS 108: Data Science in Practice. In this analysis, I examined the relationship between the number of different amenities and the review ratings of public parks, as well as the relationship between the number of different amenities and the review count, specifically for parks in San Diego County.

Surprisingly, my analysis revealed a negative correlation in both cases. The findings suggested that a higher number of amenities is associated with lower review ratings, as well as fewer review counts. You can check out my report [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/individual_fa20/blob/master/final_project/FinalProject_jamesbasa.ipynb).

```
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OLS regression
```

### Circuits
Lastly, I built exciting **electronic circuits** through various IEEE workshops. Here, you can see 4 such circuits â€” an Arduino piano, a POV light display that spells out "Hello World" when rotating, a heart-shaped circuit programmed through Arduino, and a wireless power circuit.
